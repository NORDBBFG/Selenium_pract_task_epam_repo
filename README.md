# Hello world!

Automate test cases from the previous home task using identified elements and its locators. For this practical task, Selenium WebDriver and any preferred unit test framework (NUnit, MSTest or xUnit) should be used. The type of .NET project is Class Library.

The following basic WebDriver features should be used:
browser interactions.
capabilities and features browser specifics.
explicit and implicit waits.

Enlarge the window. Use basic commands that can be executed on an element (at least click, send keys, clear).

P.S: Make all tests parameterized to practice the Data-Driven approach.
